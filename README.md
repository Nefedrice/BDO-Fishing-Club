# BDO-Fishing-Club
This will be a simple collaboration or all my Profiles and settings for Pyx.BDO. 
After all, not everything is working and needs some 'help' from the Community.

## Installation

Put 'Profiles' into your Pyx (Better Fishing) Profiles Folder folder. 
Most likely can be found here: C:\Program Files\PyxBDO\PyxBDO\Scripts\Better Fishing\Profiles

Of course you can also use my Settings, simply put it into your Better Fishing Folder.
Most likely can be found here: C:\Program Files\PyxBDO\PyxBDO\Scripts\Better Fishing\

## Usage

1. Run Better Fishing
2. Press Start
3. Of course you can change the Settings if you like :)
